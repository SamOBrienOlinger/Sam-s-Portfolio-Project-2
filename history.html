          These supernatural messers will charm you into thinking you have the upper hand and can trick or threaten them to reveal where their pot of gold is hidden. But a Leprechaun can never be outsmarted!
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Leprechauns are elusive and try to hide from humans like you and me, a rare few brave souls have seen and even captured them. Some of the first depictions of these strange little people in top hats go as far back as the Middle Ages in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar beings have existed across the globe for a very long time. From the Sanskrit 'gandharva' (semidivine celestial musicians) to the nymphs of Greek mythology and Homer, the jinni of Arabic mythology, and similar folk characters of the Samoans, of the Arctic peoples, and in the cultures of those who first inhabited the Americas.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is only in recent times that Leprechauns, like other species of Fairy, have popped up in places like children's storybooks, cartoons, and movies. 
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the earliest movies to star leprechauns is 
        <br>
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052722/plotsummary/" aria-label="Visit IMDB for more information about this movie" target="_blank">'Darby O'Gill and the Little People'</a> from 1959.

        <p>
          But once upon a time, humans took these super-duper-natural creatures very seriously indeed. Across a variety of folkloric traditions, they were a sinister force, not to be reckoned with. They were feared, dangerous, and powerful beings who were sometimes friendly to humans but could also be cruel.

    <div class="l-where">
      <div>
        <h2><img src="assets/css/Images/gold-shamrock.png" alt="shamrock bullet point"><strong>Where</strong> did they come from?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="where-drop" style="display:none">
        <p>
          Perhaps one of the most perplexing things about leprechauns is that Irish folklore has always depicted them as exclusively male. In another classic case of "women being written out of the history books," we have to wonder and ask ourselves the question:
        </p>
        <p>
          “If leprechauns are all male then where do baby leprechauns come from?” You will have to ask a leprechaun because nobody has ever been able to provide an answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the book "The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures" by John and Caitlin Matthews, the leprechaun legend can be traced back to eighth-century tales of water spirits called "luchorpán," meaning small body. The legend eventually evolved into a mischievous household fairy said to haunt cellars and drink heavily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many experts in Irish folklore believe that leprechauns come from beings called "Aos sí". Aos sí the Irish Gaelic name for a supernatural race in Celtic mythology, in Scottish Gaelic their name is Daoine Sìth, and they are similar to fairies or elves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Aos sí are said to live underground in fairy forts, across the Western sea, or in an invisible world that co-exists with the world of humans. There is a parallel world in which the Aos sí walk among the living.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Aos sí are the descendants of an ancient divine race called the "Tuatha Dè Danaan", or “peoples of the Mother Goddess Danu.” They were the last race of gods to inhabit Ireland, defeated by the Celts and Gaels who arrived later and brought agriculture to a place where hunter-gatherers previously lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although many believe that the first peoples to inhabit the island may have typically looked similar to leprechauns, i.e., had light skin tone, red hair, and green eyes.
        </p> 
          <br>
        <p>
          However, archaeologists and geneticists have discovered evidence from preserved skeletons that some of the first humans to arrive on the shores of the "Emerald Isle" 10,000 years ago, in fact, had a dark skin tone and blue eyes.
