            Although Leprechauns are elusive and try to hide from humans like me and you, 
            a rare few brave souls have seen and even captured them. 
            Some of the first depictions of these strange little people in top hats go as far back as the Middle Ages in Europe.
            
            Similar beings have exist across the globe for a very very very long time. From the Sanskrit 'gandharva' (semidivine celestial musicians) to the nymphs of Greek mythology and Homer,
            the jinni of Arabic mythology, and similar folk characters of the Samoans, of the Arctic peoples, and in the cultures of those who first inhabited the Americas.
            
            
            It is only in recent times, that Leprechauns, like other species of Fairy, have popped up in places like children's stories and movies. 
          	But once upon a time, humans took these super'duper'natural cretures very seriously indeed. 
            Across a variety of folkloric traditions, they were a sinsiter force, not to be reckoned with. They were feared, dangerous and powerful beings who were sometimes friendly to humans but could also be cruel.
