#The Irish Hexanator

# **The Irish Hexanator**

For my second Portfolio Project submitted as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in full-stack software development course, I created a fun and engaging gan=me-like random word generator called 'The Irish Hexanator'.

- To view the repository on Github **[Click Here](https://github.com/SamOBrienOlinger/Cockapoo-Club)**.

- This website was designed for Desktop users first and is responsive for users of smaller devices.  

## **Summary**
  This website provides users with a starting point for all kinds of information about owning, training and taking care of a breed of dog called Cockapoos, one of Ireland's newest, most popular and much-loved dog breeds. 
  
  Unlike many other websites that provide similar information this project offers users a unique opportunity to create and participate in their own community of likeminded pet owners at a fictional physical clubhouse and training centre in person in Dublin, Ireland.   

The site targets users in Dublin, Ireland who:

* may already have a Cockapoo dog and need more information about taking care of their dog. 

* may be thinking about getting a new Cockapoo dog and require more information to make their decision. 

Perhaps most importantly, what makes this website stand out from other websites that provide useful information about this dog breed and becoming a new owner; is how it targets users who: 

* may already be Cockapoo owners and are interested in connecting with and learning from other Cockapoo owners. 

* will find Cockapoo Club gives them a unique opportunity to join their own community and to network with other Cockapoo owners face-to-face.

* will enjoy sharing photographs of their pets and training their dogs together in person.

## **[Features](#features)**

The website consists of one page:

* [Homepage](#homepage)
* [Back to top button](#back-to-top-button)
* [Footer](#footer)

### **[Homepage](#homepage)** 

  - The landing page immediately engages the user with a large [hero image](#hero-image). The image is of a fun and scary leprechaun. This aims to set the user's expectations around the purpose of this website and to illicit a positive emotional response from the user from the very start of their experience.  

   ![TheLeprechaun](//assets/README.md-images/README.md-TheLeprechaun.png)
   

  #### **Content on Homepage**

  - The body element is divided into a number of sections with instructions fo the user to carry out step-by-step to incrementally build a full sentence. The purpose of multiple steps is to (a) differentiate this project from other simpler random word generators and (b) build the user's anticipation of seeing the final product at the end after the four easy steps of clicking or 'cursing' three times and then clikcing one more time to see the entire perosanilsed 'Hex'. 
    

### **[Back to top button](#back-to-top-button)**

  - When the user clicks on the last button on the Homepage ('Sure why not Hex that eejit again, don't they deserve it?!'), this feature aims to enhance their experience and meet their expectations of going bak to the top of the page to begin the process again to find out a diferrent result. This feature also acts as a 'Back to top' button for the user.    

    ![Back-to-top-button]()

### **[Footer](#footer)** 

  ![Footer]() 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites which would connect users with social media for The Irish Hexanator. The links open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The initial code for the social media icons for the footer was based on those found in the Code Institute's [Love Running Project](https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html) and then altered to match and be consistent with the color scheme of this project.    

  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to post their 'Hex' via social media, further enhancing the UX.

  - The icons for the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and styled to match the color-scheme based on the Irish flag's colors. 



## **[Deployment](#deployment)**

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps:

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
  - Once the Main Branch has been selected, click on the save button. The page will be automatically refreshed, a link proved, and a detailed ribbon displayed to indicate the successful deployment. 

  - The live link can be found [Here]()

## **[Features Left to Implement](#features-left-to-implement)**

- Ideas for future features include: 

  - A way for users to add and play with their own curses to prodice unique personalised 'Hexes'. 

  - A commercial page with branded merchandise with personalised 'Hexes' printed on them, such as T-Shirts, hats, mugs and other items generally found in a giftshop.  

  - A live social media platform feed where othere user's 'Hexes' can share and compare ideas for curses with images in real-time with each other. 

  - An educational feature exploring Irish folklore, myths and legends with information about the Irish language and culture surrounding superstitions and the historical origins of curses/hexes. 


## **[Testing](#testing)**
   
 - **Validator Testing**

   - **HTML**

     I began testing the HTML code early on in the project, to methodically ensure that all HTML code was being built on solid foundations across all pages. Initially, I had some basic mistakes about having more than one H1 heading and errors due to opening tags not having corresponding closing tags. With feedback from fellow students via Slack and by using the HTML Validator I have been able to fix these HTML issues.  

      * [Homepage](#homepage)

        ![homepage](assets/README.md-images/README.md-index-html-valid.png)


   - **CSS**
    
      Testing the CSS code was also carried out with each developmental stage of the project. Most often the errors that arose were with syntax for media queries and stray curly braces.  

        ![CSS Validator]()
    

   - **Lighthouse** 

    Initially, I intended all of the images on the website, especially the Furry Fun Foto Gallery page, to be my own photography with family, my own dog and with friend's pets. However, coordinating this proved to be more time consuming and difficult than I originally envisaged, especially with health implications of socialising due to COVID. Instead, I have used a mix of my own photographs and images from open-source websites covered in the [Images](#used-images) section. 
    
    Below are the Lighthouse scores.    
     
    - Mobile
      
      * [Homepage](#homepage)

            
    - Desktop 

      * [Homepage](#homepage)
          
        ![Homepage]()
      
          


  - **Feature testing**

    Testing all interactive features involved manually clicking on every link on each page.

    - All social media links in footer bring the user to the corresponding social media platform for them to log in. 
    - the input field is interactive and adds the inputted text to the final full sentence or 'Hex'.   

    ## **[Users experience](#users-experience)**

      The target audience was kept as broad as posisble. Challenges and factors thqt had to be kept in mind when developing this project while placing UX at the cntre included: 
      
      - Users' varied levels of digital literacy
      - their familiarity with using games online
      - the general diversity of target users' age range and social backgrounds
      
      I felt I needed to ensure that anyone would be able to navigate and enjoy the website. Keeping it as simple as possible for the user was a main priority. Also, eliciting a positive emotional response from users was central to the success of the website and to achievng the aim of creating and developing a website that would be experienced differnetly and stood out from other kinds of pre-exisiting random word generators.

## **[Credits](#credits)**

As a starting point I began with a cocnept for a random word generator based on a book entilted [The Irish Insult Generator](https://shop.designist.ie/products/irishinsultgenerator). On finding out that an App produced by another party but with almost exactly the same name already existed called [Irish Insult Generator](https://steprimo.com/android/us/app/com.incrediblegeeks.irishinsultgenerator/Irish-Insult-Generator/), I developed the idea to maintain the random word aspect but to enhance this with the idea of 'putting a hex' on a firend or family member for fun and being able to post this to social media.   


### **[Code](#code)**

- Below is the code for the footer element. This was based on the footer used in the Code Institute's Love Running Project module:   

~~~
<footer>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                    aria-label="Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                    aria-label="Visit our Twitter page (opens in a new tab)"><i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i></a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                    aria-label="Visit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)"><i class="fab fa-youtube-square"></i></a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://instagram.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                    aria-label="Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a>
            </li>
        </ul>
  </footer>
~~~

   While the above code is essentially the same for the footer in this project, I altered the color to match the color-scheme. In this project the footer aims to enhance UX by offering the user a way to post their 'Hex' to the various social media platforms via the linked icons provided, and to tag their 'Nemesis' for fun.  

### **Content**

- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
     
   
 - **[Images](#used-images)**

    - The only image used was dowloaded for free from  [Geeks of Doom](https://geeksofdoom.com/2012/03/20/wwe-films-and-lionsgate-are-teaming-up-to-reboot-leprechaun-franchise)
